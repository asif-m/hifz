4:12. And you men shall receive half of what your wives leave, if they have no inheriting descendant, though if they have an inheriting descendant, you shall receive
a quarter of what they leave;
both of these after
fulfilling any bequests they have made, or debts.
And they shall collectively receive a quarter of what you leave, if you have no inheriting descendants, though if you have inheriting descendants, they shall collectively receive an eighth of what you leave,
after any bequests you have made, or debts.
And if a man or woman dies leaving an inheritance
and has no living ancestors or descendants, but has one maternal half brother or half sister, that one receives a sixth,
though if they are more than one, then each receives an equal share of a third, after any bequests made or debts paid, provided the deceased did not intend to harm the heirs by the bequest;
A mighty injunction from Allah, and Allah is all-knowing, graciously long-forbearing.
----
4:13. Those are the bounds of Allah, and whoever obeys Allah and His messenger, He shall enter into lush-shaded groves of paradise beneath which rivers flow, therein to abide one and all;
And that is the mighty undying triumph.
----
4:14. And whoever disobeys Allah and His messenger and willfully transgresses His limits, He shall enter him an awful fire, in it to abide desolately alone;
And he shall have
a degrading chastisement.
