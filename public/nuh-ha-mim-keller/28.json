just as it was prescribed for all those ever before you, that haply you may attain godfearingness.

2:184. A matter of but a few days:
So whoever of you is ill or on a journey, then let him fast the same number of other days.
And those who could have barely borne the fast must instead pay an expiation for each day: the feeding of an unfortunate;
And whoever does even more of the good than that, it is better for him, though fasting is better for you, if you all but knew.

2:185. The month of Ramadan
is that in which the Quran was first sent down, a supreme comprehensive guide to mankind, and surpassing clear proofs of guidedness vindicating it, and the Sole Final Criterion.
So whoever of you is present during the month, let him fast it;
And whoever is ill or on a journey,
then let him fast the same number of other days:
Allah wants ease for you,
and does not want unbearable hardship for you;
And so that you all may complete the full number, and magnify Allah in praise for having guided you, and that haply you may show thanks.

2:186. And when My servants ask you of Me, truly I am near;
I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me:
So let them truly answer Me and believe in Me, that haply they may go right.
