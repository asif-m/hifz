2:77. Can they really not know
that Allah knows all they conceal and all they reveal?
----
2:78. And some among them are unlettered, who know the Book not,
but only vain hopes fabricated for them by their learned.
They nothing but surmise.
----
2:79. So woe to those who write the Book with their own hands,
and yet more outrageous in enormity, say over and over:
"This is from Allah Himself, to buy a paltry price thereby.
So woe to them
from what their hands have written, and woe to them
from what they earn and earn.
----
2:80. And they have said:
"The hellfire shall never even touch us, save a handful of days.'
Say: Have you taken a covenant from Allah Himself, for Allah never breaks His word;
Or do you utter against Allah what you know not.'
----
2:81. By no means!
Whoever earns himself a monstrous ill deed, and is compassed round by his wrongdoing, those are the denizens of hell, in it shall they abide.
----
2:82. And those who believe and work righteous deeds, those are the dwellers of the lush-shaded grove of paradise, in it shall they abide.
----
2:83. And remember when We took the solemn covenant of the children of Israel:
You shall worship naught but Allah, and show every kindness to parents,
and to next of kin, orphans, and the unfortunate, and say gracious words to people,
and perform the prayer, and give the due alms.' Yet incredibly you turned away, breaking your word, save very few of you indeed, while you have ever been averse.
