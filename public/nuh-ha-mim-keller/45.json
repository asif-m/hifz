2:265. And the striking similitude of those who spend their wealth
earnestly seeking the lasting good pleasure of Allah,
and out of determined resolve born of deep conviction from themselves, is like a lush orchard on a fertile rise that is struck by a downpour, so it redoubles its yield;
And had it not been struck by a downpour, even a slight rain would do it well;
And Allah well sees all you do.
----
2:266. â€”Or would any of you care to have a grove luxuriant with date palms and grapes beneath which rivers flow
in which he has all kinds of fruits, then be stricken decrepit with old age,
and have feckless offspring unable to manage for themselves, then it be suddenly hit by a whirlwind bearing fire within it,
and go completely up in flames?
Thus does Allah make plain to you the verses, that haply you may reflect.
----
2:267. O you who believe,
spend of the fair things of what you have earned, and what We have brought forth for you from the earth, and do not purposely pick the worst, expending from it
when you would never accept it yourselves, unless you turned it a blind eye.
And know well that Allah is free of any need, all-laudable in bounty.
----
2:268. The Devil promises you poverty and bids you disgrace,
while Allah promises you a mighty forgiveness from Himself and limitless bounty,
and Allah is vast of favor, all-knowing.
----
2:269. He gives wisdom to act to whomever He willis, and whoever is given wisdom has been given immeasurable good.
Yet none remember and heed but those of insight and mind.
