2:94. Say, 'If you alone shall have the Final Abode reserved by Allah,
and none else of mankind,
then long for death if you be telling the truth?

2:95. And never shall they long for it, ever, because of what their hands have sent ahead, and Allah well knows the wrongdoers.
----
2:96. And you will always find them the most grasping of all mankind for any last pathetic shred of life, even more than idolaters.

and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael:
Verily Allah is a dire enemy to unbelievers.

2:100. Then whenever they have made a solemn covenant:

2:101. And when a momentous messenger reached them from Allah Himself,
confirming all they already possessed, a faction of those given the Book
flung the very Book of Allah behind their backs, as if they knew not full well.
