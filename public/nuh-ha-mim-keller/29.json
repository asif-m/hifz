2:187. It has been made licit for you the whole night before the fast to take conjugal liberties with your women:
They are your garments and you are their garments;
Allah well knew you had been wholly betraying yourselves, so He then relented in lenience towards you and pardoned you.
So now lie with them
and seek what progeny Allah has inscribed for you.
And eat and drink until the horizon's white thread is fully plain from the night's black thread, of the break of dawn;
Then finally complete the fast to the night;
But lie not with your wives while on retreat in mosques:
Those are the bounds of Allah, so come not even near them.
Thus does Allah
make plain His verses to mankind, that haply they may attain godfearingness.

2:188. And do not devour your property between you by foul means, then dangle it before those who judge, so they justify it, that you may devour
a share of other people's wealth through sin, when you know full well.
----
2:189. And they ask you about new moons.
Say: 'They are the times that specify worship for men and the pilgrimage.
Nor is it aught of true devotion to come to your homes from behind them, to keep by ruse your pilgrim sanctity;
But rather devotion to Allah in all works of good means he who is godfearing
So enter homes by their doors and fear Allah,
that haply you may succeed?
----
2:190. And fight in the path of Allah those who fight you,
but commit no transgression whatsoever;
Verily Allah loves not transgressors.
