4:75. So how can you not fight in the path of Allah, and for the downtrodden
—of men, women, and small children unable to emigrate-who say: Our Lord, take us out of this town whose people are idolatrous oppressors, and bestow us from Yourself a powerful protector, and bestow us from Yourself a powerful ally?
----
4:76. Those who believe fight in the path of Allah:
And those who disbelieve fight in the path of the Abominable One:
So fight the minions of the Devil;
Verily the wiles of the Devil were ever weak.

4:77. Or can you not have seen those who were once told:
"Stay your fighting-hands for the present, and perform well the prayer and give the due alms?
But no sooner was fighting prescribed upon them, than lo, a faction of them turned out to dread men as direly as they did Allah Himself, or even more,
and said: 'Our Lord, why have You prescribed fighting upon us;
Had only You respited us a little longer?
Say: 'The fleeting enjoyment of this paltry world is truly little, and the next world is far better for whoever is godfearing;
Nor shall you be wronged
by even the thread of a date-stone?

4:78. Wherever you are, death will overtake you, were you in towering impregnable white-cased citadels.
And if good fortune befalls them, they say, 'This is from Allah?
And if any ill hits them, they say, 'This is from you?' Say: 'Each is from Allah?
So how is it that such people can hardly tell what is meant by words?
----
4:79. Whatever good befalls any of you, is but from Allah, and whatever ill strikes you is brought on by yourself.
—And We have sent you to mankind as an envoy, And Allah suffices as Witness.
