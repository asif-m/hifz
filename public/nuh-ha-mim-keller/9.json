2:58. And remember when We said:
Enter this town,
and eat at your whole leisure from it wherever you will;
And enter the city-gate bowed humbly low in atonement, and say: 'Disburden us of all our sins,' and We shall forgive your many misdeeds;
And shall increase the greater those who excel in good.
----
2:59. But those who did wrongs straightway substituted words in no way like what they had been told;
So We sent down from the sky
a staggering devastation on the wrongdoers, for the godlessness they would not cease.
----
2:60. And remember when
Moses sought water for his people,
and We said, 'Smite the solid rock with your rod,' and twelve springs burst forth from it.
Each tribe well knew their own drinking place:
Eat and drink of Allah's ever-renewed provision, and work not iniquity across the earth, corrupting it.
----
2:61. And remember when you said to Moses,
O Moses, never can we bear just one food, so call on your Lord, that He bring forth for us from what the earth grows,
its greens, long gourds, wheat, lentils, and onions?
He said: Do you eagerly seek what is worse in place of the better?
Get you all down to a great city,
and you are sure to have the pathetic things you have asked?
And fixed indelibly upon them
were humiliation and broken-spiritedness,
and they came back having incurred utter wrath from Allah.
That was for their ever disbelieving in the wondrous verses and signs of Allah, and slaying the very prophets without right:
And that in turn was for their disobeying, and transgression they would not end.
