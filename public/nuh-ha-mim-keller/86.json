4:45. And Allah better knows your enemies, and Allah suffices as a protecting friend, and Allah suffices as an all-victorious ally.

4:46. Of Jewry are those who pervert sacred words from their right places, and say: 'We hear you and disobey,' and 'Hearken, may you be deaf,' and "Tend well to us, be you fuddled,
to insolently twist words with their tongues and malign the religion.
Had they but said: 'We hear and obey,' and 'Pray listen,' and 'Regard us,' it were better for them and fitter.
But Allah has cursed them for their unbelief, so they believe not, but pitiably little.
----
4:47. O you who have been given the Book, believe in what We have now sent down, confirming what you already possess,
while there is yet time, before We wipe away faces for very horror, and return them as featureless as the backs of their heads;
Or curse them utterly altered into subhumans, even as We cursed the breakers of the Sabbath:
And the command of Allah was ever invariably accomplished.
----
4:48. Truly Allah forgives not
that anything be associated with Him in mis-worship, but forgives anything short of that for whomever He wills.
And whoever associates anything with Allah has fabricated a monstrous iniquity.
----
4:49. Or can you not have seen those of Jewry who extol their own sanctity?
Rather Allah extols and makes grow to full purity in faith and deed whom He wills;
And they shall not be wronged the thread of a date-stone.
----
4:50. Behold how they forge lies against Allah, and it suffices as plain iniquity.
----
4:51. Can you not have seen
those who were given a great share of the Book:
They believe in the abomination of idols,
and in the sordid minions who exalt the idols in others' eyes;
And they say to those who disbelieve: "These idolators are more rightly guided in path than those who believe?"
