----
3:133. Vie with headlong speed
to a mighty forgiveness from your Lord and a tremendous lush-shaded grove of paradise whose breadth is the heavens and earth, prepared for the godfearing:
----
3:134. Those who expend in good times and in bad, and who constrain their rage, and who wholly pardon other people;
And Allah loves
those who ever excel in good,
----
3:135. And loves those who when they commit a heinous deed or wrong themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins,
—And who forgives sins but Allah?—
And do not keep on doing what they have done, when they know:
----
3:136. All those shall be requited a mighty forgiveness from their Lord, and luxuriant groves of paradise beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein;
And how surpassing fair the wage of those who work!
----
3:137. The same invariable ways
have come and gone in all ages before you:
So journey in the earth and just see how was the end of those who cried lies.
----
3:138. This is a clear explanation unto men, and a supreme guidance and warning to the godfearing.
----
3:139. And grow not faint or grieve, when it is you who shall win, if believers you truly be.
----
3:140. If you have been dealt a wound, the other side has been dealt a wound like it;
While those are the triumphant days We bestow in turn between men;
And so Allah may openly know those who truly believe, and choose martyrs from among you;
And Allah loves not wrongdoers;
