2:220. On this world, and the next.
And they ask you about orphans.
Say: To improve their lot is better,
and if you mix your lives and wealth together, they are your brothers,
and Allah well knows the spoiler from the improver:
Had Allah wished, He could have taxed you to breaking;
Verily Allah is all-powerful, all-wise.
----
2:221. And marry not women who worship others with Allah, until they believe;
For indeed, even a bondswoman who believes
is better than she who worships others with Allah, though she please you.
Nor marry men who worship others with Allah to your women, until they believe;
for indeed, even a bondsman who believes
is better than he who worships others with Allah, though he please you:
Those summon to the hellfire;
While Allah summons to lush-shaded paradise and a mighty forgiveness, by His leave;
And He makes plain to men His verses, that haply they may remember.
----
2:222. And they ask you about menstruation; Say: It is foul, so leave off from women while in their menses, and approach them not until again pure.
And when they purify themselves,
have unto them whence Allah has enjoined you:
Verily Allah loves the oft-repentant,
and loves those who remain pure from any reproach.
----
2:223. Your womenfolk are a fertile tillage for you, so have unto your tillage from whenever you wish.
And send ahead for yourselves, and fear Allah,
and know that you are certain to meet Him;
And give glad tidings to believers.
----
2:224. And make not Allah
a mere target set up for your oaths, to hinder from good works and being godfearing and reconciling between men.
And Allah is all-hearing, all-knowing.
