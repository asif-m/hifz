2:275. Those who devour usury shall not rise on the Last Day, save as he rises who is repeatedly beaten down by the Devil in a seizure, so he falls crazily about in his gait:
That is because they say that trade is but like usury, while Allah has made trade lawful and usury unlawful.
So whoever an impending warning reaches from his Lord, then desists, may keep what has passed, and he shall be judged by Allah.
But whoever returns as he was before, those are the denizens of the hellfire, in it shall they abide.
----
2:276. Allah wears away usury down to nothing, but increases every form of charity,
and Allah loves no disbeliever, wicked with sin.
----
2:277. Verily those who believe and do righteous deeds, and perform well the prayer, and give the due alms,
shall have their wage with their Lord, and need never be feared for, nor shall they grieve.
----
2:278. O you who believe, fear Allah, and completely discard any usury still due, if believers you truly be.
----
2:279. If you will not, then hear and know of a dreadful war against you from Allah and His messenger;
And if you repent and desist, you may keep your original wealth, neither wronging nor being wronged.
----
2:280. And if there is someone unable to repay due to grinding poverty, give him respite till well-off,
though to forgive the debt in charity is better for you, if any of you but knew.
----
2:281. And fear an unspeakable day when you are all returned to Allah;
Then, and yet graver, every soul shall be paid back in full What it has earned,
while they shall not be wronged.
