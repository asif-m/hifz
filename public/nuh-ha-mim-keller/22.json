2:142. The fools of men shall say:
What has turned them round
from the gibla they so long faced in prayer?' Say, To Allah belong East and West:
He guides whomever He wills to an exalted straight path?
----
2:143. And so too have We made you a select nation of faith, nobly upright in equity,
that you might be witnesses over all men, and the Messenger alone be witness over you.
Nor did We appoint the gibla you used to face, save to openly know
who should faithfully follow the Messenger from him who would turn back on his heels;
And verily it was nigh intolerably dire, save for whom Allah guided;
And never was Allah even about to waste your faith:
Verily Allah is to mankind all-tender and compassionate.
----
2:144. We certainly see you frequently turning your face about the sky in eager anticipation;
So We will now indeed turn you to a gibla direction that well pleases you;
So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque;
And wherever any of you may be, turn your faces towards it:
And verily those who have been given the scripture know full well it is the truth from their Lord;
Nor is Allah the least heedless of all they are doing.
----
2:145. And were you to bring those given the scripture every sign in proof,
they would not follow your qibla;
Nor are you about to follow their qibla;
Nor are they about to follow the gibla of one another:
Were you to obey their many vain fancies right after what has reached you of knowledge, you would certainly be of utter wrongdoers.
