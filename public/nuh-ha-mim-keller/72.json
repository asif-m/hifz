----
3:166. And what befell you the day the two hosts met
was but by the leave of Allah,
and that He might openly know the true believers;
----
3:167. And openly know those who showed rank hypocrisy, and were told, 'Come fight in the path of Allah, or at least repel the common foe!'
They said, 'If we knew any fighting would take place, we would certainly follow you?
On that day they showed themselves closer to unbelief than belief:
They ever say with their mouths what is not in their hearts;
And Allah knows better what they conceal.
----
3:168. Those who said at the plight of their fellow kin and townsmen, while they themselves sat back, 'Had they only obeyed us, they would not have been killed?
Say: 'So fend off death from yourselves, if you are so truthful?
----
3:169. Nor ever deem those slain in the path of Allah to be dead: Rather they are alive, with their Lord, being provided for;
----
3:170. Overjoyed at what Allah has given them out of His pure favor, and filled with gladness for those who have yet to join them from just behind, that they need never be feared for, nor shall they grieve;
----
3:171. Filled with gladness
at a supreme blessing from Allah and immense bounty,
and that Allah wastes not the wage of believers.
----
3:172. Those who resolutely answered the call of Allah and His messenger right after being badly wounded;
Those of them all who excelled in goodness and were godfearing have an incomparable wage;
----
3:173. Those to whom men said,
'Verily men have massed against you, so fear them!
Yet it only increased them in faith, and they said, 'Allah suffices us, and is the best reliance?
