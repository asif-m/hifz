2:113. The Jews have pathetically said: "Christians are on nothing?
and the Christians pathetically said: Jews are on nothing, while both assiduously read the scripture;
Just so have those tribesmen who know nothing of any scripture said their very words!
So Allah shall judge between them all on Resurrection Day upon that on which they so long disagreed.
----
2:114. And who is greater in wrong
than he who prevents the mosques of Allah from His name being remembered in them, or strives for their ruin?
Those shall never enter them save in fear;
They have in this world a great humiliation;
And in the next world a mighty chastisement.
----
2:115. To Allah belong the entire East and West;
Wherever you turn to the direction of prayer,
There is the face of Allah in favor:
Verily Allah is limitlessly vast of power and ease, all-knowing.
----
2:116. And they say, 'Allah has taken Him offspring, far exalted be He above it!
Rather His is everything in the heavens and earth:
To Him all meekly submit.
----
2:117. Originator of the heavens and earth:
When He decrees a thing, He but tells it 'Be' and it is.
----
2:118. And those tribesmen who know nothing of any scripture say:
'Why does Allah not speak to us, or any sign reach us to prove you true?' Just so did all those before them say their very words:
Their hearts are just alike.
Verily We have made full plain in proof the mighty signs of verses, for a people completely certain.
----
2:119. Verily We have sent you with the Truth, a bringer of glad tidings and tremendous warner, while never shall you be asked about the denizens of the blaze.
