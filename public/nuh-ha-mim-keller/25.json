2:164. Truly in the creation of the heavens and earth;
And alternation of night and day;
And ships that course the sea bearing benefit to man;
And in what Allah has sent down of wondrous plentiful water from the sky, and revived the earth with it after it had died,
and dispersed far and wide in it of every creature;
And in changing the shifting winds;
And in the clouds meekly humbled between sky and earth:
Are a multitude of mighty signs for men who comprehend.
----
2:165. Yet some people take rivals short of Allah whom they love as much as Allah;
While those who believe are greatest in love for Allah.
—If idolatrous wrongdoers could only see when they behold the chastisement that all indomitable might together belongs to Allah,
and that Allah is unsparing of chastisement—
----
2:166. When those who were zealously followed shall disown their faithful followers, having all seen the chastisement, and the ties they clung fast to are cleft all apart.
----
2:167. And those who zealously followed shall say:
If we could only go back and disown them as they disowned us?
Just so shall Allah show them their works as boundless bitter regrets to them, while they are never to leave the hellfire.
----
2:168. O mankind: Eat of all that is on earth, lawful and delicious,
and follow not eagerly the steps of the Devil;
Verily he is your open foe.
----
2:169. He but commands you to commit the appalling and indecency, and to utter against Allah what you know not.
