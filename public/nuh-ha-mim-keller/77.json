4:1. In the Name of Allah Most Merciful and Compassionate:
O mankind, fear your Lord who created you from a single soul, and created of it its mate,
and spread far and wide from them a multitude of men and women;
And fear Allah by whom you entreat one another, and fear what is due to the wombs of your kinship:
Verily was Allah ever at watch over you.
----
4:2. And deliver to orphans all their property:
Nor exchange your own wholesome wealth for what is ill-gotten,
or greedily devour their wealth unto your own:
Verily it was ever a heinous crime against those under one's care.
----
4:3. And if you fear taking unjust advantage by marrying propertied orphan brides under your care, marry instead any who please you of other women:
You may each have two or three or four, though if you fear not being fair between them, then but one,
or however many bondmaids your right hands may own.
That is likelier not to incline unfairly towards just one.
----
4:4. And give women their due marriage payment as an openhanded gift, and if they are full pleased at heart to give up any of it, then eat of it, wholesomely and heartily.
----
4:5. Nor give orphans who are fools with money their wealth, which should be as carefully cherished
as your own, that Allah has made the support of your lives, but provide for them out of it and clothe them, and speak words of kindness to them.
----
4:6. And test the common sense of orphans until they reach the age of marriage, and if you see any maturity in their dealings, give them their wealth at once,
and do not consume it prodigally to outrace their coming of age.
And let him with wealth take nothing of his charge's.
And whoever is impoverished,
let him consume only what is reasonable and proper.
And when you deliver to them their wealth, have witnesses over them;
And Allah suffices as a reckoner.
