2:102. And instead they immersed themselves in what
godless fiends had made up and assiduously recounted own through the years against the sovereign reign of Solomon:
While Solomon did not commit unbelief, but the godless fiends disbelieved:
They ceaselessly taught men sorcery and what was sent down unto the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut,
while these would never teach a single soul until they had said:
'We are but a deadly temptation so commit not unbelief!'
Whereat they would learn from them that by which they would turn a true man against his own beloved wife,
—while they harm no one at all thereby save by the leave of Allah—
and they learn what grievously harms them, and helps them not the least.
And truly have these at present well understood that whoever eagerly buys it shall never in the next world have any share of the good;
And how evil a price indeed
is what have they sold their souls for, if they had only known.

2:103. Had they only believed and shown godfearingness, the merest recompense from Allah Himself is incomparably better, if only they could know.

2:104. O you who believe:
do not say, 'Give us time to grasp it,' but rather say, 'Regard us,' and hearken;
And the unbelievers who mock your phrase in their own Hebrew tongue shall have a painful chastisement.

2:105. Neither those who disbelieve of the people of the Book, nor the idolaters. have the slightest love for any good to be sent down to you all from your Lord;
While Allah favors with His mercy whom He wills;
And Allah is vast of favor.
