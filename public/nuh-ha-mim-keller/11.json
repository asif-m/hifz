2:70. They said, Pray to your Lord for us, and He shall make clear to us what it should be:
Verily cows are all alike to us, and certainly, Allah willing, we shall be guided?
----
2:71. He said, 'Verily He says
it should not be a cow so servilely low that it throws up dust behind a plow, or waters tillage;
Free of any blemish;
With no other patch of color in it.'
They said, Now you have brought the whole truth?
And so they slaughtered it, while they almost would not.
----
2:72. And when you took an innocent life, and all wholly denied it and accused each other;
While Allah was to bring forth what you kept concealed.
----
2:73. And We said, 'Strike him with a piece of it':
Even thus does Allah raise the dead, and show you His incomparable signs, that haply you may comprehend.
----
2:74. Yet after even that your hearts grew hard again, so they are like stones or even worse:
For of stones is that from which rivers burst;
And that which splits and water issues forth;
And that which plummets down from the very dread of Allah:
Nor is Allah the least heedless of all you do.
----
2:75. Can you hope they will unwaveringly believe you all, when a faction of them used to hear the word of Allah, then actually change it as soon as they had understood it, knowing full well?
----
2:76. And when they meet those who believe, they say, 'We believe?'
And when back alone with themselves, their leaders say:
'Are you telling them what Allah
has divulged to you in your own scripture confirming their prophet, so they may make a case with it against you when you reach your Lord:
Can you not even think?'
