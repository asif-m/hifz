4:34. Men shall have whole charge of their wives, because Allah has favored the one above the other, and because they have spent well of their wealth:
So righteous women are lovingly obedient, dutifully keeping everything secure when their husbands are gone through Allah's own protection;
While those who you fear may show rude defiance, first patiently admonish them, then draw away from them in bed,
and failing all else, you may finally even strike them:
And if they return to obedience, seek no way against them:
Verily was Allah ever exalted in might over you, supreme in greatness.
----
4:35. And should you fear a rift between man and wife, send an arbiter from his kin and an arbiter from hers;
And if both truly desire to settle between the couple, Allah will restore harmony between them;
Verily Allah was ever all-knowing, all-aware.
----
4:36. And worship Allah
and ascribe nothing whatsoever as partners to Him;
And be gracious and kind to parents, towards next of kin, and orphans, and the poverty-stricken, and neighbors who are kinsmen, and neighbors who are not, and the friend at your side, and destitute wayfarers,
and bondsmen your right hands own;
Verily Allah loves no conceited braggart:
----
4:37. Those who withhold with the tight fist of cheapness, and urge others to be miserly, and conceal all mention of what Allah
has sent down and bestowed them of His bountyâ€” And We have prepared for unbelieving ingrates a humiliating chastisement.
