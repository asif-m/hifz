2:211. Ask the children of Israel
just how many a clear miraculous sign We vouchsafed them:
And whoever exchanges away the blessing of Allah as soon as it has come to him, verily Allah is unsparing in requital.
----
2:212. The pathetic life of this world
has been decked out fair to those who disbelieve, and they mock at believers;
While the godfearing shall be far above them on the Day of Resurrection;
And Allah unfailingly provides for whomever He wills without reckoning.
----
2:213. All men were of one common faith, so when disunity befell, Allah sent great prophets bearing glad tidings and giving warning,
and sent down with them the scripture with entire Truth so it might judge between men about that on which they disagreed.
And none disagreed over it but the very ones it had been sent to, just after the unmistakably clear proofs had reached them, out of factious rivalry over worldly followers and gain, with savage words and deeds beyond all bounds between them.
So Allah has now guided those who believe to that which those before disputed about of the Truth, by His leave;
And Allah guides whomever He wills to an exalted straight path.

2:214. Or did you assume you would enter paradise when you have not yet met with the proverbial fate of all those who ever passed away before you:
Dire want and affliction touched them sore, and they were utterly shaken, until the very Messenger and those who believed with him said:
'When is the help to victory from Allah to come?'
Verily the victory from Allah is near!
----
2:215. They ask you what they should expend;
Say: Whatever good you expend,
it is for parents, closest family, orphans, the poverty-stricken, and the destitute wayfarer; and whatever good you do, Allah knows it full well.
