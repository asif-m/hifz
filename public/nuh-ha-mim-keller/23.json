2:146. Those whom We have given the scripture recognize him as the foretold Prophet as well as they know their own sons;
And verily a faction of them conceal the truth while knowing full well:
----
2:147. That is the truth from your Lord, so never be of those who cavil with what is plain.
----
2:148. Each nation of faith has a direction it has set itself towards;
So surpass them all to the highest of spiritual works.
From wherever you may be,
Allah shall instantly bring you all together:
Verily Allah has absolute power to do anything.
----
2:149. And from wherever you set out,
turn your face in prayer towards the Sacred Mosque;
And verily it is the truth from your Lord;
Nor is Allah the least heedless of what all of you do.
----
2:150. And from wherever you set out,
turn your face in prayer towards the Sacred Mosque;
And wherever any of you may be, turn your faces towards it:
That men may have no pretext against you, save those of them deliberately doing wrong.
So fear them not, but fear you Me;
And that I may complete My blessing upon you;
And that haply you be ever guided:
----
2:151. â€”Just as We have sent amongst you a great Messenger from yourselves who ever recites unto you Our verses, makes you grow to full purity in faith and deed, teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you never knew.
----
2:152. So remember Me:
I shall remember you.
And show Me thanks: not base ingratitude.
----
2:153. O you who believe,
seek help through patience and the prayer;
Verily Allah is with the dauntlessly patient.
