2:225. Allah will not take you to task for thoughtlessly uttered oaths,
but will take you to task for what your hearts intentionally earn;
Verily Allah is all-forgiving, long-forbearing.
----
2:226. Those who forswear going unto their wives have a four months' period of grace:
So if they return to being on good terms, surely Allah is all-forgiving, all-compassionate.
----
2:227. But if they decide on divorce, surely Allah is all-hearing, all-knowing.
----
2:228. Divorced women shall wait with themselves three monthly periods,
nor is it lawful for them to keep secret what Allah has created of menses or pregnancy within their wombs, if they truly believe in Allah and the Last Day.
And their husbands have a better right to take them back therein, than they have to refuse,
if reconcilement is actually what the husbands intend.
And women possess rights
like those they are bound to fulfill, in lawful fairness, while men possess a single degree in rank above them;
And Allah is all-powerful, all-wise.
----
2:229. The divorce that can be returned from may be pronounced up to two times,
then either honorably retaining her, or kindly letting her go.
Nor is it lawful for you to take back anything of what you have given them,
unless husband and wife fear they cannot keep the bounds of Allah, so if those of you in charge fear that they cannot keep the bounds of Allah, they incur no fault in whatever she may pay to be released.
Those are the bounds of Allah, so transgress them not;
And whoever willfully violates the bounds of Allah, those are the wrongdoers.
----
2:230. So if he pronounces divorce upon her a final time,
she is no longer lawful to him again until after she may wed someone else;
So if the latter then divorces her after its consummation, there is no sin in her returning to her first husband, if they believe they can keep the bounds of Allah.
And those are the bounds of Allah, which He makes plain to a people of knowledge.
