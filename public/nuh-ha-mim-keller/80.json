4:15. And those of your wives who commit adultery:
Find four eyewitnesses of you
who have each actually seen them in the very act, and if they so testify, then confine them to homes till death claims them,
or Allah decides another way out for them.
----
4:16. And if an unwed couple of you commit it, reprove them severely,
and if they cease, repent, and sincerely mend their ways, then leave off from them;
Verily Allah was ever oft-forgiving, all-compassionate.
----
4:17. Allah is but bound to forgive those who do ill out of folly, then even after a time, repent soon enough:
Those are whom
Allah turns to in forgiveness;
And Allah was ever all-knowing, all-wise.
----
4:18. There is no forgiveness
for those who commit ill deed after ill deed, until when death overtakes one of them, he says 'I now repent';
nor for those who die in unbelief.
For those We have prepared a painful chastisement.
----
4:19. O you who believe,
it is by no means lawful for you to inherit wives against their will.
Or to keep them miserably married to you so as to make off by settlement with some of what you have given them in marriage payment, unless they commit outrageous misbehavior.
But rather live with them graciously and reasonably;
If you merely dislike them, you may well dislike something, and Allah make tremendous good in it.
