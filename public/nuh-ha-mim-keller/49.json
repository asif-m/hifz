2:283. And if you are journeying and find no scribe,
then any collaterals taken in hand
may insure deferred payment in place of writing;
But if one of you instead accepts another's word on trust, then let him who has been entrusted deliver his trust,
and let him fear Allah his Lord.
And let none of you conceal what he has been made witness of;
And whoever shall conceal it, his heart has worked evil;
And Allah well knows all you do.
----
2:284. Allah's is everything in the heavens and everything on earth,
and if you reveal what is in your hearts or conceal it,
Allah shall reckon with you for it:
He forgives whomever He wills, and punishes whomever He wills,
and Allah has absolute power to do anything.
----
2:285. The Messenger believes in all
that has been sent down to him from his Lord, as do true believers:
Each and every one believes in Allah
and His angels and His Books and His messengers:
'We differ not between any of His messengers,'
and all say: 'We hear and obey;
Your own divine forgiveness, our Lord; and to You is the final return.
----
2:286. Allah does not tax any soul but what it can bear: it shall have all it earns, and but pay for what it commits.
O Lord, take us not to task if we forget, or make an honest mistake;
O Lord, nor place upon us a binding hard burden as You did on those ever before us;
Nor then requite us with what we have no strength to bear;
But pardon us, forgive us, and show us bounteous mercy, You are our One Supreme Master,
so give us triumph over the people of the unbelievers?
