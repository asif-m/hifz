3:10. Truly those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor sons shall avail them anything from Allah;
And those are the fuel of hell.
----
3:11. Theirs is but the same inveterate way as that of the men of Pharaoh and all those who ever came before them:
They cried lies to Our signs, so Allah seized them for their sins;
And Allah is unsparing of requital.
----
3:12. Tell those who disbelieve:
"You shall be inevitably vanquished and driven in mass to the hell abyss, and how evil a bed made!
----
3:13. 'Verily you have a momentous sign in two forces that met,
one fighting in the path of Allah,
and another disbelieving, beholding the former as though twice as many as themselves, as sure as eye may see;
And Allah aids with His victory whomever He wills.'
Verily in that is a mighty reflection for those of true insight.

3:14. Love of mere desires
has been decked out fair to mankind,
of women, sons, fortunes amassed of gold and silver, proud horses bearing noble marks of distinction, flocks and herds, and tillage:
Such is the fleeting enjoyment of the paltry life of this world;
And Allah, with Him
is the most wondrous fair return.
----
3:15. Say: 'Shall I give you tidings of far better than any of those?
The godfearing have with their Lord
luxuriant groves of paradise beneath which rivers flow, therein to abide, and bevies of purest brides, and supreme divine good pleasure from Allah Himself;
And Allah sees servants full well?
