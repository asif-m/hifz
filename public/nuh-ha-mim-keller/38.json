2:234. And those of you who are claimed by death, and who leave behind wives: let them wait with themselves for four months and ten nights.
And when they finish their waiting period,
none of you in charge bear any sin or fault for whatever they may respectably decide to do with themselves;
And Allah is well aware of all you do.
----
2:235. You bear no sin for hinting at marriage to such women in their waiting period, or for what you may harbor within yourselves.
Allah well knows you would say something to them, but do not secretly promise to marry each other, other than to hint with words correct and chaste.
And do not effect the marriage contract until the prescribed period has finished its term.
And know that Allah
well knows what is in your souls, so beware of Him;
And know that
Allah is all-forgiving, long-forbearing.
----
2:236. You bear no sin if you divorce women before having yet lain with them
or stipulated for them a named marriage payment;
And give them an amenity payment instead:
The affluent must give according to his means, and the needy according to his means, a reasonable amenity from each, bounden on those who do good.
----
2:237. And if you divorce them before having lain with them, when you have stipulated them a stated marriage payment, then they receive half of what you have agreed upon, unless they forgo payment,
or the guardian in whose hand is the marriage contract forgoes payment;
And your forgoing it is closer to godfearingness.
And forget not to show gracious bounty to each other;
Verily Allah sees all you do.
