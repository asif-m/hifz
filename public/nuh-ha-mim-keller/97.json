4:114. There is no good at all in a great many of their secret conversations, save he who bids
to charity, or to do good, or make up between people at odds:
And whoever does that
to win the lasting good pleasure of Allah, We shall unfailingly bestow a mighty wage.
----
4:115. And whoever sets the Messenger at defiance just as soon as true guidance has become plain to him and stubbornly follows a path no way like that of true believers, We shall consign him to what he has mis-followed, then roast him in the glowering depths of hell, and how evil an end!
----
4:116. Truly Allah forgives not that any else be worshipped with Him,
but forgives anything short of that to whomever He wills;
And whoever worships anything else with Allah is hopelessly lost away.
----
4:117. They supplicate nothing short of Him but pathetic female idols;
And supplicate in reality only a malefic wicked Devil,
----
4:118. Whom Allah has cursed,
and who has sworn in reply: 'I will certainly take of Your slaves a share I have set as mine!
----
4:119. 'And I swear to lead them astray, and fill them with disastrous empty hopes, and bid them crop the ears of livestock camels in consecration to idols,
and command them to deform the creation of Allah?
And whosoever takes the Devil
as his strong protecting friend short of Allah, has lost everything in clear utter ruin.
----
4:120. He promises them,
and fills them with disastrous vain hopes,
while the Devil promises them nothing but rank deception.
----
4:121. Those, their refuge is the glowering hell abyss, from which they will never find any way to escape.
