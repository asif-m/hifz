3:154. And despite all,
He sent down on you after your woe an utter relief of safety,
a soft drowse of peace that overspread a party of you;
While another party of you were troubled with themselves, believing of Allah what was remote from any truth, suspicions of the bygone age of pagan ignorance, saying:
Have we anything of the promised matter of victory?'
Say, 'Verily the matter is entirely Allah's?
They conceal in themselves
what they disclose not to you, saying:
"Had we anything of the promised matter, we would not have been slain in a place like this?
Say, 'Had you been in your very homes, those for whom it was inscribed to be slain would have appeared where they would finally lie?
And that Allah might try what is in your breasts, and purify what is in your hearts of all dross;
And Allah well knows the very secrets harbored within breasts.
----
3:155. Verily those of you who turned and fled when the two hosts met,
the Devil by cunning turns made them slip and fall because of something of what they had incurred;
And Allah has now truly pardoned them:
Verily Allah is all-forgiving, most clement.
----
3:156. O you who believe,
be not like those who have disbelieved, and said of their fellow kin and townsmen whenever they travel the land,
or are unstinting fighters in the path of Allah:
'Had they only been with us,
they would not have died or been slain?
That Allah may make it a bitter regret in their hearts;
And Allah alone bestows life or death;
And Allah sees very well all you do.
----
3:157. Verily if you are killed in the path of Allah or perish, the merest forgiveness from Allah and mercy are better than all they amass.
