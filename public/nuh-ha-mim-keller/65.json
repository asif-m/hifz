3:116. Verily those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor sons
shall avail them the slightest from Allah:
Those are the denizens of the fire, in it shall they abide.
----
3:117. The strikingly strange similitude
of the good that they expend in the pathetic life of this world is like that of a gale-wind in which was deathly biting cold that struck the tillage
of a people who had wronged themselves, and laid it waste.
Nor has Allah wronged them, but they only wrong themselves.
----
3:118. O you who believe, do not take as intimates those from outside your own faith:
They spare you no ill they may do, and would love you to suffer greatly;
Utter hatred has already escaped their lips, while what their breasts conceal is far greater.
We have made clear to you the verses, if you would comprehend.
----
3:119. Here you are, these who love them, though they love you not,
while you believe in all revealed scripture together.
And when they meet you they say, 'We believe;
And when alone they bite their fingertips over you in rage.
Say: 'Perish in your rage!
Verily Allah well knows
even the secrets harbored within breasts?
----
3:120. If the slightest good touches you, it dismays them;
And if some trouble hits you, they exult in it;
While if you are steadfast and godfearing, their guile will not harm you;
Verily Allah encompasses everything they do.
----
3:121. And remember when you set out early from your womenfolks arranging for the believers their battle-posts, And Allah is all-hearing, all-knowing.
