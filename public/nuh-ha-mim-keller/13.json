2:84. And remember
when We took your most solemn covenant:
'You shall not spill each other's innocent blood, or drive one another from your habitations';
And yet more, you confirmed its bindingness on you, acknowledging it down through all the generations.
----
2:85. Yet incredibly, here you are, these very ones:
It is now you who slay each other in local battles, and drive out a party of your own selves from their very homes, leaguing yourselves with one or the other gentile tribes against them in whole sin and transgression;
And when they reach you as lowly captives therefrom, you "charitably" ransom them-while the very expelling of them was unlawful for you!
So do you believe in part of the Book, and disbelieve in part?
Then what may be the requital of whoever of you does that, but abject humiliation in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection,
they shall be taken forcibly back to the most unsparing chastisement;
Nor is Allah the least heedless of aught you do.
----
2:86. Those are who have eagerly purchased the life of this world with the life of the next:
So the chastisement shall not be lightened from them, nor shall they be helped.
----
2:87. Verily did We give Moses the Book, and made follow in his footsteps so many other messengers;
And bestowed Jesus son of Mary wondrous manifest proofs, and succored him with the Purest Angelic Spirit.
So did you, whenever a messenger brought you what your hearts did not care for, show haughty disdain;
so that one party you cried lies to, and another you would actually slay?
----
2:88. And they say:
'Our hearts are innately encased shut from your message?'
Rather has Allah cursed them for their unbelief;
So little do any of them believe at all!
