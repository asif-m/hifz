2:231. And when you divorce women, and they near the end of their waiting period, then either retain them honorably or release them honorably;
And do not retain them to inflict harm and commit transgression:
And whoever does something so vile as that, has certainly wronged himself.
And do not take the verses of Allah Himself as a mockery, and remember the blessing of Allah upon you, and what He has sent down unto you of the Book and wisdom, warning you therewith.
And fear Allah, and know
that Allah well knows every single thing.
----
2:232. And when you divorce women,
and they have reached the end of their waiting period, then let not those of you in charge keep them miserably from remarrying their husbands, when they honorably agree to do so between themselves.
Even thus is warned whoever of you believes in Allah and the Last Day:
That is purer for your spiritual growth, and purer of heart;
And Allah well knows, and you know not.

2:233. Mothers divorced shall suckle their children two full years, for parents who wish to complete the suckling;
And their support and clothing shall be the charge of him to whom the child was born, in honorable measure:
No soul shall be taxed but what it can comfortably bear.
No mother shall suffer because of her child, nor father because of his;
and should the father die, his heir shall bear the charges.
So if the father and divorced mother
want the child weaned in less than two full years,
out of their mutual agreement and seriously conferring together, they incur no fault thereby.
And if you fathers want other wet nurses instead for your children, you incur no sin thereby, when you
deliver to them the wages you have stipulated for them in honorable fairness.
And fear Allah, and know that Allah sees all you do.
