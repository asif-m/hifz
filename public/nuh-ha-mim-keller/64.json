3:109. And Allah's is everything in the heavens
and everything on earth,
and to Allah shall all matters be returned.
----
3:110. You have proved the finest nation of faith ever brought forth to mankind:
You bid the right and forbid the wrong and firmly believe in Allah.
If only the people of the Book had so believed, it had been better for them.
Of them are those who have truly embraced faith, yet most of them are the godless.
----
3:111. Never shall they undo you, but only inflict harm;
And should they wage you battle, they would turn tail on you and flee, and never, and even worse, win again.
----
3:112. Humiliation has been indelibly stamped upon them wherever they have been caught, other than through a rope from Allah and a rope from men:
And they came back with utter wrath from Allah, and were marked thereafter with abject lowliness:
That was for their refusing except unbelief in the very signs of Allah,
and killing so many prophets without the slightest right;
All of which was because they kept disobeying, and transgressed again and again.
----
3:113. Yet they are not all alike:
Of the people of the Book are a great number now upright,
who recite the verses of Allah in the reaches of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer;
----
3:114. Who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and bid the right and forbid the wrong, and outrace in every kind of the best deeds:
And those are of the supremely righteous.
----
3:115. And whatsoever good they do, it shall never be denied them;
And Allah well knows the godfearing.
