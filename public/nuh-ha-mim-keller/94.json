4:95. Not equal are those of the believers
who sit out from combat while nothing is wrong with them, and those who do battle in the path of Allah with their wealth and their lives:
Allah has favored those who battle with their wealth and lives above those who sit out by an immeasurable degree.
To each has Allah promised the supreme good of paradise;
And Allah has favored those who do battle above those who sit out
an incomparably magnificent wage:
----
4:96. Innumerable exalted ranks from Him and a mighty forgiveness and mercy;
And truly was Allah ever all-forgiving, all-compassionate.
----
4:97. Verily those whom the angels reclaim the souls of, when they have been iniquitously wronging themselves, are asked by them, 'In what spiritual straits were you?' They say, 'We were helplessly oppressed in the land?
They ask, 'Was Allah's earth not vast enough for you to emigrate in?'
Those, their refuge is the glowering depths of hell, and how evil an end!
----
4:98. But not the truly downtrodden, of men and women and young children without any stratagem to win free, or guided to any path to do so.
----
4:99. Those Allah may well pardon, and verily was Allah ever all-pardoning, all-forgiving.
----
4:100. And whoever emigrates in the path of Allah shall find across the earth many a fast refuge to defy any foe, and true affluence;
And whoever so much as leaves his home emigrating to Allah and His messenger, and yet more, whom death then overtakes, his wage falls bounden upon Allah;
And verily was Allah ever all-forgiving, all-compassionate.
----
4:101. And when any of you journey in the earth, there is no fault in your shortening some of the prayers, should you fear that those who disbelieve may offer you harm;
Verily unbelievers are your manifest foe.
