2:25. And give bounteous glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous works, that they shall have lush-shaded groves of paradise beneath which rivers flow;
As often as they are given, of any fruit of them, ample delicious regular provision,
they say, 'This is fully what we have been brought just before!' and they are given its very match in perfection.
And they shall have bevies of purest wives therein;
And in it they shall abide.

2:26. Verily Allah is not abashed to strike any similitude whatever, even of a gnat or anything greater.
As for those who believe,
they know it is the truth from their Lord.
And as for those who disbelieve, they say:
What would Allah ever mean by this, as a preposterous similitude?'
He thereby misguides a great many, and by it He guides a great many, not misguiding by it any, save the ungodly;
----
2:27. Who break their word to Allah just as soon as it has been solemnly given, and who sever the ties Allah has bid be kept, and wreak corruption across the earth:
Those are the wholly ruined.

2:28. How can you disbelieve in Allah, when all of you were dead, and He brought you to life, then in time shall make you die, then in time bring you back to life,
then finally and greater, unto Him shall you be returned?
----
2:29. It is He who created just everything on earth for your sake;
And greater yet, He had turned His full intent to the sky before, perfecting it in consummate symmetry as seven heavens; and He well knows every single thing.
