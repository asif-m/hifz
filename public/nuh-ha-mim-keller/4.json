2:17. Their strange similitude is like someone who gathered a mighty fire, but when it brightly lit up everything round,
Allah took away their light
and left them in depths of darkness without sight;
----
2:18. Deaf, dumb, and blind, never to return.
----
2:19. Or like those caught in a downpour from the sky, in which there are palls of darkness, and thunder and lightning;
They push their fingers into their very ears from the thunderblasts in fear of death,
while Allah encompasses unbelievers.
----
2:20. The lightning almost snatches away their sight;
Whenever it lights their way, they walk in it;
And when it casts them back in blackness, they just stand.
Had Allah willed,
He had taken away their hearing and sight:
Verily Allah has absolute power to do anything.
----
2:21. O mankind: Worship your Lord who created you
and all those before you, that haply you might be godfearing.
----
2:22. Who has made the earth a bed outspread for you, and the sky a magnificent firm-canopied edifice; and sent down wondrous water aplenty from the sky, and brought forth with it, from fertile crops, constant lavish provision for you;
So give not rivals to Allah while you know.
----
2:23. And should you be truly in doubt about what We have sent down on Our servant, then bring but one sura anything like it and call upon any to aid you or attest, short of Allah,
if you are so truthful.
----
2:24. So if you do not, and you never shall,
then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones:
It is prepared for unbelievers.
