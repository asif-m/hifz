2:127. And remind them when Abraham was raising lofty the foundations of the Sacred House, and Ishmael:
Our Lord, accept from us;
Verily You are the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
----
2:128. Our Lord, and make us entirely submissive to You;
And make of our seed
a single faith of people who wholly submit to You;
And show us our rites of pilgrimage, and forgive us all:
Verily You are the Oft-forgiving, the All-compassionate.
----
2:129. 'Our Lord, and raise and send forth among them a great messenger from themselves,
who will unfailingly recite unto them Your verses, and teach them the Book and wisdom,
and make them reach full purity in faith and deed:
Verily You are the Invincible, the All-wise?
----
2:130. And who is averse to the faith of Abraham but someone who makes himself a fool?
Verily We chose him in this world, and certainly in the next one he shall be of the supremely righteous.
----
2:131. And remind them when his Lord said to him, 'Submit, he said, 'I fully submit to the Lord of all Worlds of Beings.'

2:132. And Abraham strictly enjoined his sons to do so, as did Jacob:
My dear sons, Allah truly has chosen for you the one pure religion;
So let none of you die, save entirely submitting?
----
2:133. Or were any of you present as witnesses, when death came to Jacob, when he said to his sons,
"What shall you worship after I am gone?' They said, 'We shall ever worship your God, and the God of your fathers:
Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac;
one single God, submitting to Him alone?
----
2:134. That indeed was a magnificent stock of people now come and gone:
None but they possess what they earned, and none but you possess what you have earned;
Nor ever shall you be asked about what they used to do.
