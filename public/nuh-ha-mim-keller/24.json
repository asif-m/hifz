----
2:154. And say not of whoever is slain in the path of Allah they are dead: Rather are they alive, but you are not aware.
----
2:155. And We shall try you with some little of fear and hunger,
and loss of wealth, lives, and crops;
And give great glad tidings to the patient:
----
2:156. Those who say when any calamity strikes them,
'Verily we are Allah's,
and to Him are we bound to return?
----
2:157. Those, on them shall be endless tender blessings from their Lord in light and help, and mighty mercy, and those are the guided.
----
2:158. Verily Safa and Marwa are sites of Allah's worship.
So whoever makes pilgrimage to the Sacred House or the lesser visitation, there is no wrong or harm in making many a round between them.
And whoever does more of the best than even that,
Allah truly is supreme in thanks, all-knowing.
----
2:159. Verily those who conceal what We have previously sent down
of the decisive clear verses of proofs, and guidance, just when We had made it plain to men in scripture;
Those does Allah curse,
and they are accursed by all who may curse.
----
2:160. Save for those who repent and mend their ways, and make fully known what they had concealed:
Those shall I relent towards;
And I am the Oft-forgiving, the All-compassionate.
----
2:161. Verily those who commit such unbelief, and die while unbelievers,
on them is the curse of Allah and the angels, and mankind all together;
----
2:162. Ever to abide therein:
Never shall the chastisement be lightened from them nor they given any respite.
----
2:163. And your god is but One God, no god is there but He,
the Most Merciful and Compassionate.
