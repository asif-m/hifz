2:6. Verily those who stubbornly disbelieve, it is all the same to them if you warn them or warn them not:
They shall not believe.
----
2:7. Allah has sealed shut their hearts and their hearing,
and their eyes are enwrapped in a great blindfold;
And they shall have an immeasurable chastisement.
----
2:8. And of men are actually some who say,
"We believe in Allah and the Last Day,' while they are no believers at all.
----
2:9. They try hard to deceive Allah and those who believe, while they deceive none but themselves, and cannot even tell.
----
2:10. In their hearts is an utter sickness so Allah has increased them in sickness;
And they shall have a painful chastisement because they lied and lied.
----
2:11. And whenever they are told,
"Work not corruption across the earth,' they say, 'We are but putting things right?'
----
2:12. Verily are they the corrupters, but are not even aware.
----
2:13. And when they are told,
'Believe as other people believe, they say, 'Shall we believe as fools do?' Verily indeed are they the fools, but do not even know.
----
2:14. And whenever they meet those who believe, they say, 'We believe.'
And when back alone to the godless fiends who lead them, they say, 'Verily we are wholly with you; We are only mocking?
----
2:15. Allah is mocking them,
and giving them rope in their excesses, lost blindly in a daze.
----
2:16. Those are who have eagerly bought pathetic misguidance with true guidance,
so their trade profited nothing, and they were ever hopelessly unguided.
