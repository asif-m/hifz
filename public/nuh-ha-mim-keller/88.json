----
4:60. Or can you not have seen those who claim to have believed
in all that has been sent down to you, and ever sent down before you:
They actually want to take their dispute to be judged by one of the heads of idolatrous deviltry,
when they have been commanded by their Book to abjure them, and the Devil wants to lead them hopelessly far astray.
----
4:61. And if they are told,
'Rise and come
to what Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger,'
you see the hypocrites turning from you wholly away.
----
4:62. So how then when a calamity strikes them for what their hands have sent ahead, and they finally come to you swearing by Allah,
'We but wanted to do well by both sides, and settle amicably between them';
----
4:63. Those are the ones
whom Allah well knows what is in their hearts, so refrain from punishing them, but severely warn them, and speak to them telling words that penetrate their very souls.
----
4:64. Nor have We sent any messenger
except to be obeyed by Allah's express charge and leave;
And had they only when they wronged themselves come to you at once and asked Allah's forgiveness, and the very Messenger asked forgiveness for them, they had found Allah ever-forgiving, all-compassionate.
----
4:65. But no, by your Lord, they do not believe,
until they make you sovereign judge of the disputes that embroil them, nor ever again find any rankle in their hearts at what you decide, but submit in total meekness.
