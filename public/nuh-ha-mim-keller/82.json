4:24. Or women already married, other than those your right hands own
by having been taken captive in war.
All the forgoing
is bindingly proscribed to you by Allah;
And everything besides that has been made lawful to you to seek through your wealth, chaste in marriage, not fornicating libertines.
And whomever of them you enjoy the privileges of marrying, give them their due wages in marriage payment, a solemn binding obligation, though you bear no burden or sin for whatever you mutually agree to waive, even after having agreed on its being due:
Verily Allah was ever all-knowing, all-wise.
----
4:25. And whoever of you cannot afford to marry chaste believing freewomen, let him marry those owned by others of you, of your believing servant girls;
And Allah knows best the real rank of your faith:
You are all of one another.
So marry them
by the leave of those they belong to,
and give them their marriage payment graciously when they are chastely married, not rank harlots or mistresses of lovers.
And when they marry, should they commit fornication, they bear but half the penalty borne by unwed freewomen.
â€”All of which is for those of you who fear to fall prey to the crushing woe of fornication:
For otherwise, to bear patiently with being chastely unmarried is better for you than marrying bondmaids.
And Allah is oft-forgiving, all-compassionate.
----
4:26. Allah truly wills to make plain to you all, and guide you the exemplary ways of those in all times before you, and forgive you;
And Allah is all-knowing, all-wise.
