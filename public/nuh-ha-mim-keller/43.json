2:257. Allah Himself is the faithful protecting friend of all who shall believe,
He brings them out of deepest darknesses into light.
And those who disbelieve,
their protectors are the abomination of idols:
They take them out of the light into deepest darknesses;
Those are the denizens of the hellfire, in it shall they abide.

2:258. Can you not have regarded him who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, merely because Allah had given him kingship;
When Abraham said, My Lord alone bestows life and death.'
He said, I bestow life on those I spare, and death on those I do not.'
Abraham said, 'Allah brings forth the sun from the east:
So bring it forth from the west.
And he who disbelieved was dumbfounded;
And Allah guides not the people of wrongdoers.

2:259. Or can you not have considered the like of him who passed upon a ruined town, its walls fallen in on its roofs.
He said, 'How should Allah revive this after it has perished?'
So Allah made him die a hundred years, then finally raised him again.
He said, 'How long have you bode here?' He said, 'I have bode a day or part of a day?
He said, 'Rather you have bode one hundred full years:
So look at your food and drink, it has not aged, yet look at your donkey;
And that We may make you a mighty sign, in proof to all mankind;
Now look at the bones how We raise them up, then even more wondrous, clothe them in flesh?
And when it was plain to him, he said,
'I now know well
that Allah has absolute power to do anything.
