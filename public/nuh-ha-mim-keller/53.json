3:23. Can you not have seen those given a great share of the Book, while called again and again
to the Book of Allah to give judgement between them, yet incredibly, a whole group of them turn away, completely averse?
----
3:24. That is because they have said,
'The hellfire shall never even touch us, but for a matter of days';
And the lies they invented
led them wrong about their own religion.
----
3:25. So how should it be when We amass them all for an unspeakable day, no doubt is there in it, and every soul shall be paid back in full what it has earned, while none of them shall be wronged?
----
3:26. Say, O Allah, Lord of all Sovereign Power:
You give power to whomever You will, and wrest power from whomever You will;
And exalt whomever You will, and abase whomever You will;
In Your hand is all good;
Verily You have absolute power to do anything.
----
3:27. "You enter the dark of night into where the very day was, and enter the dawning day into the departing night;
And bring forth the living from the dead, and the dead from the living;
And unfailingly provide for whom You will without reckoning.
----
3:28. Let not believers take unbelievers as allies instead of believers:
Whoever does such a thing has nothing to do with Allah, unless you but fear something from them
that you must reassure them in words to protect yourselves from:
And Allah warns you of Himself;
And to Allah is the final return.
----
3:29. Say, If you conceal what is in your hearts or reveal it,
Allah already knows it;
And He knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth;
And Allah has absolute power to do anything.
