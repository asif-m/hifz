4:66. Had We prescribed to them to
"Take your own lives, or 'Forsake your habitations, they would not have done it, save very few of them;
So if only they had done what they are being admonished to, it were better for them,
and firmer in setting fast their faith and lives,
----
4:67. And verily then We had bestowed on them from Our own self a mighty wage,
----
4:68. And truly guided them an exalted straight path.
----
4:69. And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger shall be with those Allah has truly blessed, of the prophets, the utterly true, the martyrs, and the wholly righteous:
And how excellent are those as companions!
----
4:70. All that is the very favor of Allah, and Allah suffices to know everything.
----
4:71. O you who believe, take your every precaution:
Turn out to battle band after band, or turn out to battle all together.
----
4:72. And verily among you is the laggard who hangs back, and if any calamity strikes you, says without qualm:
'Allah truly blessed me, as I was not there with them.
----
4:73. And when you are met with
any bounty from Allah, he says, as if there had
never been any solicitous love, born of faith, between you and him:
'Had only I been with them, and realized a princely gain!'
----
4:74. So let only those fight on in the path of Allah who would eagerly sell
the pathetic life of this world for the next;
And whoever does battle in the path of Allah and is either slain or victorious,
We shall unfailingly give a mighty wage.
