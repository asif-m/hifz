3:141. And that Allah may purge believers from all dross, and wear down unbelievers to naught.
----
3:142. Or did you assume you would enter paradise, when Allah has not yet openly known those of you who would fight for the Truth, and openly known the truly steadfast?
----
3:143. And you had been fervently wanting to meet death in battle before you met it;
So now you have beheld it, looking plainly on.
----
3:144. Nor is Muhammad save a messenger, whom all prophetic messengers have passed away before:
So if he dies or is killed,
will you turn back on your heels the way you came?
And whoever turns back on his heels from faith shall not harm Allah in the slightest.
And Allah shall fully requite the grateful.
----
3:145. And no being could ever die but by the leave of Allah:
A bounden writ to an appointed term.
And whoever seeks the reward of this mere life,
We shall give him thereof;
And whoever seeks the reward of the next, We shall give him thereof, and shall fully requite the grateful.
----
3:146. And how many a prophet was fought beside, by a host of those he raised to godly virtue.
Yet they grew not faint of heart
for all that struck them in the path of Allah, nor weakened, nor succumbed;
And Allah loves the truly steadfast.
----
3:147. And they said nothing but:
'Our Lord, forgive us our sins, and excesses we should never have done, and make our feet unshakably firm,
and give us triumph over the people of the unbelievers?
----
3:148. So Allah bestowed them the reward of this life, and the very perfection of the reward of the next, And Allah loves those who excel in good.
