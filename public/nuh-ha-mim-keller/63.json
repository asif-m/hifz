3:101. And how should any of you commit unbelief,
when the verses of Allah are recited to you time and time again, and His messenger is among you?
And whoever holds fast to Allah to protect him has been guided to an exalted straight path.
----
3:102. O you who believe,
fear Allah as He should be feared, and never die but in total submission.
----
3:103. And hold fast to the rescuing rope of Allah all together and divide not asunder,
and remember the blessing of Allah upon you, for you were foes, and He reconciled your hearts, and you became brethren by His grace, while you were on the brink of a yawning chasm of the hellfire, and He saved you from it.
Thus does Allah make plain to you His verses, that haply you may be guided.
----
3:104. And let there be a signal number of you who call to good, and bid the right and forbid the wrong:
Those are the successful forever.
----
3:105. And be not like those
who fell at odds between them and completely disagreed, just when the unmistakably clear proofs of unity had reached them:
Those shall have an immeasurable chastisement,
----
3:106. On a day when a great many faces shall whiten, and a great many faces go black;
So as for those whose face goes black,
'Have you disbelieved after your belief?
Then taste the chastisement for refusing but unbelief!'
----
3:107. And as for those whose face whitens, they shall be in the mercy of Allah, ever in it to abide.
----
3:108. Those are the verses of Allah, which We recite to you with utter Truth;
And Allah never so much as wills the slightest wrong to any being.
