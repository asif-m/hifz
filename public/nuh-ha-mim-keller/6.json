----
2:30. And remind them when your Lord said to the angels:
I shall place a noble reigning deputy on earth?
They said, 'Will You place in it
one who will wreak corruption in it again and again, and spill much innocent blood;
While we extoll Your infinite glory in praise, and Your exalted pure perfection?'
He said, 'Verily I well know what you know not.'
----
2:31. And He taught Adam the names one and all,
then after, and more telling, showed all those named to the angels and said:
"Tell Me the names of these if what you say is true?'
----
2:32. They said, 'You are limitlessly exalted beyond all ken, we know naught but what You have taught us;
Verily You alone are the All-knowing, the All-wise.'
----
2:33. He said, 'O Adam, tell them their names.' So when he had told them their names, He said:
'Did I not tell you I know the entire unseen of the heavens and earth, and all you make known, and all you have kept concealed?'
----
2:34. And remind them when We said to the angels, Fall down in homage to Adam,' And they all bowed down to him as one;
But not Satan: he utterly refused, waxed high and haughty, and was wholly of the unbelievers.
----
2:35. And We said: 'O Adam, dwell in peace, you and your wife, in the lush-shaded grove of paradise, and eat of it in abundant ease wherever you wish,
but come not even near to this tree, lest you be of the grave wrongdoers.'
----
2:36. But the Devil caused them to slip from it, and took them out of everything they had been in;
And We said, Fall all of you down far below, enemies to one another;
And you shall have a fair biding-place on earth, and passing enjoyment till a time?'
----
2:37. Then Adam eagerly took great words of repentance from his Lord, so He turned back to him in forgiveness;
Verily He is the Oft-forgiving, the All-compassionate.
