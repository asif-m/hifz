3:174. So they returned
with an immeasurable blessing from Allah and pure favor, untouched by the least harm;
And they pursued the supreme good pleasure of Allah;
And Allah is incomparable of favor.
----
3:175. That spoken to you by those
was merely the Devil, making his minions seem frightening:
So fear them not, but fear you Me, if true believers you be.
----
3:176. Be not dismayed
by those racing headlong in unbelief:
Never shall they harm Allah the slightest.
Allah but wants to give them no share of any good in the next life, and they shall have a mighty chastisement.
----
3:177. Verily those who eagerly purchase unbelief with faith will never harm Allah in the slightest;
And they shall have a painful chastisement.
----
3:178. Nor let unbelievers deem that Our leaving them be for so long is better for them: We but leave them so long that they may increase in utter sin;
And they shall have a degrading chastisement.
----
3:179. Allah was never even about to leave true believers just as you are, mixed with those who are not,
until He distinguishes the vile from the good.
Nor ever was Allah about to disclose the unseen to you all, but rather Allah chooses from His prophetic messengers whomever He wills;
So believe in Allah and His messengers;
And if you believe and are godfearing, you shall have a tremendous wage.
----
3:180. And let not those who unjustly withhold with the tight fist of greed what Allah has given them of His bounty deem it better for them:
Rather it is woefully worse for them:
What they so withhold shall be made fast round their necks on the Day of Resurrection.
And to Allah alone is the inheritance of the whole heavens and the earth;
And Allah is well aware of what you do.
