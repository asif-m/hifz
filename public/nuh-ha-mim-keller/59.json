3:71. O people of the Book, why do you mix up the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth, when you know full well?
----
3:72. And a group leading the people of the Book pathetically say:
'Believe in what has been sent down unto those who believe at the beginning of the day and disbelieve at the end of it, that haply they may renege,
----
3:73. 'And do not confide in anyone save him who follows your own faith?' Say, 'Guidance means to be guided by Allah:
Is this how you act, merely lest someone else be given what you yourselves have,
or may make a case against you before your Lord!' Say, 'Verily all favor is in the hand of Allah:
He bestows it on whomever He wills, and Allah is vast of bounty, all-knowing.
----
3:74. 'He favors with His mercy whom He wills;
And Allah is vast of favor.'
----
3:75. Of the people of the Book is him whom if you entrust with a fortune, will pay it back to you;
And of them is him whom if you entrust with a single dinar, will never give it back to you, until you stand perpetually over him.
That is because they say, 'We bear no blame for anything we do to gentiles?'
And they utter lies against Allah, knowing full well.
----
3:76. By no means!
Whoever keeps his solemn plighted word and fears Allah,
truly Allah loves the godfearing.
----
3:77. Verily those who eagerly buy a miserable price with the covenant made to Allah and their oaths, never shall those have any share of good in the next life;
Nor shall Allah speak to them,
or even look at them on the Day of Resurrection, or purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement.
