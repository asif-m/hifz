3:181. Allah has truly heard
the words of those mocking at revelation, who said:
'Verily Allah is in penniless need, while we are wealthy?
We shall unfailingly record what they have said, and their having long slain so many prophets without the slightest right,
and We shall say: Taste the chastisement of the raging fire.
----
3:182. "That is for what your own hands have sent ahead;
And that never would Allah greatly wrong other servants by leaving the wicked unpunished.

3:183. Those who said, 'Truly Allah has made covenant with us that we are not to believe in any messenger, until he brings a mighty offering devoured completely by fire?'
Say: 'A multitude of great messengers in all times before me have brought you clear miraculous proofs, and that which you say:
So why did you slay them if you speak the truth?'
----
3:184. So if they nonetheless cry you lies, then
all of the many great messengers have certainly been cried lies before you, who brought unmistakable miraculous proofs, mighty inscribed Books of wise admonition, and light-giving scripture.

3:185. Every living creature shall taste death, and you shall only be repaid your full deserts on the Day of Resurrection:
So whoever is wrested from the hellfire and entered into the lush grove of paradise has triumphed forever;
While the pathetic life of this world is nothing but the passing enjoyment of delusion.
----
3:186. Verily you shall be tried
in your wealth and in troubles with yourselves;
And you shall hear a great deal of abuse from those given the Book no great while before you, and the Arab pagans who worship others with Allah:
And if you are dauntless and godfearing, truly that is of the most crucial resolves.
