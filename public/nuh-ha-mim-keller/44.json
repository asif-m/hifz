2:260. And recall when Abraham said,
'My Lord, show me how You revive the dead' He said, 'Have you not then already long believed?'
He said, 'I certainly have,
yet so my heart may be serene in peace?' He said, 'Then take four birds, draw them near to you,
then afterwards put a piece of each of them on every mountain, then summon them back, and they will speed to you at once;
And know that Allah is invincibly powerful, all-wise?

2:261. The remarkable similitude of those who spend their wealth in the path of Allah is like that of a single grain that put forth seven bounteous ears of grain, in every ear a hundred grains;
And Allah multiplies whole times over for whomever He wills;
And Allah is bountifully vast, all-knowing.
----
2:262. Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, never again after to remind those given of it, or offend them, they shall have their wage with their Lord, and they need never be feared for, nor shall they grieve.
----
2:263. A decent word, though giving nothing, and forgiving the ill-manners of those asking, are better than charity that is followed by offending;
And Allah is free of need for anything, graciously long-forbearing.
----
2:264. O you who believe, do not nullify all your charity by reminding those given of it, and offending them, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, while he does not believe in Allah or the Last Day.
His strikingly strange similitude is like that of sowing the ground atop a smooth rock that is struck by a downpour, leaving it utterly bare:
They can avail themselves of nothing they have earned.
And Allah guides not the people of unbelievers.
