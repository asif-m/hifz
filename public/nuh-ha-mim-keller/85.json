4:38. Nor does He love those who spend their wealth to be seen of men, and believe not in Allah or the Last Day;
And whoever's ever-shadowing companion is the Devil, how evil indeed a companion!
----
4:39. And what should it harm them, did they believe in Allah and the Last Day, and spend well of what Allah provides them?
And Allah has ever known all about them.
----
4:40. Verily Allah wrongs not by so much as the weight of a speck of dust;
And if that much be a good deed, He compounds it whole times over, and bestows from His very Self a truly mighty wage.
----
4:41. So how shall it be,
when We bring forth a witness from every nation of man, and bring you over these as a witness?
----
4:42. On that day those who denied faith and disobeyed the Messenger shall yearn if only the earth could be leveled clean over them, while they cannot conceal from Allah one word.
----
4:43. O you who believe, do not go even near the prayer when you are drunken,
until you can tell what you are saying;
Nor when ritually unclean,
unless just passing through the prayer-place, until you bathe.
And if you are too ill to use water, or on a journey that prevents you,
—or one of you has come from answering nature, or you have lain with women and cannot find water—
then go and take the high clean surface of the earth, and wipe well your faces and hands;
Verily ever was Allah all-pardoning, all-forgiving.
----
4:44. Can you not have seen those who have been given a great share of the Book, yet again and again buy pathetic misguidance, and strive to make you lose the way?
