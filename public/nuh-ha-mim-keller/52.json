3:16. They are those who say,
Our Lord, verily have we believed, so forgive us our sins, and keep us from the chastisement of the fire';
----
3:17. The dauntless in patience, the true in word and deed, the humbly devoted in adoration, the ever-spending of their wealth for good, and those who ask forgiveness in the final watches of the night.
----
3:18. Allah proclaims there is no god but He;
as do the angels and those possessed of knowledge:
Eternally championing justice.
No god is there but He, the Invincible, the All-wise.
----
3:19. Verily religion in Allah's sight is utter submission:
Nor did those who were given the scriptures fall into dissension, but just when the knowledge thereof had reached them, out of factious rivalry over worldly followers and gain, with savage words and deeds beyond all bounds between them.
And whoever disbelieves in the signs of Allah, Allah is unerringly swift to reckon.
----
3:20. So if they dispute with you,
say: I have submitted my whole being to Allah, and so has whoever faithfully follows me?
And say to those given the scriptures
and to the unlettered Arabs who have never known any:
"Will you then submit?'
And if they submit to faith, they are certainly guided; but if they turn away, you are only bound to convey, and Allah sees servants full well.
----
3:21. Verily those who deny the verses of Allah and slay the very prophets without the slightest right, and slay those of men who enjoin justice:
Give them glad tidings of a painful chastisement.
----
3:22. It is those whose works have perished to nothing in this world and the next;
Nor have they any who may help.
