4:102. And when you are among them and conduct the prayer for them,
let one section of them stand at prayer with you and let them keep their weapons, and when they finish their prostrations, let them mount guard just behind you, and let the other part of them who have not yet prayed
come forth at once and pray with you, and let them take their fullest caution and keep their weapons:
Those who disbelieve would love
for you to overlook your weapons and battle gear, that they might fall on you at one fell swoop.
And it is no fault for you
if you suffer from rain or are seriously ill to put down your weapons during it;
But take your fullest caution:
Verily Allah has readied for unbelievers a humiliating chastisement.
----
4:103. And when you have completed the prayer, make remembrance of Allah standing and sitting
and upon your sides at rest.
And when you are again secure, keep full well the prayer:
Verily the prayer is bounden upon believers at an indelibly prescribed time.
----
4:104. And slacken not in seeking the foe:
If you suffer,
they suffer as you do, and you hope from Allah that which they hope not;
And truly was Allah ever all-knowing, all-wise.
----
4:105. Verily We have sent down to you the Book with entire clarity, Justice, and Truth,
to judge between men by what Allah has shown you;
So dispute not on behalf of traitors.
