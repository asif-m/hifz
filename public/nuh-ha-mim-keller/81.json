----
4:20. And if you eagerly seek
to change one wife for another,
and have given the one even a fortune as a marriage payment, do not take back the slightest bit of it in payment from her to release her from marriage.
Would you take it back, leaving your victim speechless with the outrage of impugning her character, as an excuse to others for your taking it, and in manifest sin?
----
4:21. And how should you take it back,
when you have cleaved unto each other in wedded union, and they have taken of you a grave covenant?
----
4:22. And marry no women ever wedded by your male ancestors, though what once used to take place of it shall not be stigmatized as wrong or illegitimate:
Verily it was ever a heinous indecency, utterly loathsome, and appalling as a way.
----
4:23. It has been made unlawful for you to wed your female ancestors, your female descendants, your sisters and half sisters,
your aunts and great-aunts, on up, from your father's side or your mother's,
the female descendants of your brothers or half brothers, the female descendants of your sisters or half sisters;
And your wet nurses who thus became your mothers by feeding you their milk,
and any girls they wet-nursed who thus became your sisters;
And the female ancestors of any women whom you marty, and the daughters raised in your very laps from the previous marriages of your wives with whom you have consummated your marriage, though if you did not consummate it with them, there is no objection or sin, after the marriage has ended, in your marrying their daughters.
And any wife wedded by your male natural descendants;
Or joining between two sisters at one time, though what once used to take place of it shall not be declared wrong or illegitimate;
Verily was Allah ever all-forgiving, compassionate;
