----
2:170. And when they are told,
Faithfully follow what Allah has sent down, they say, Rather, we faithfully follow whatever we but found our forefathers on?
What, even if their forefathers understood nothing, and had no guidance?
----
2:171. The strange similitude of unbelievers is like someone calling again and again to herd animals who hear nothing but
a cry that beckons them near,
or a shout that warns them off from far:
Deaf, dumb, and blind, they cannot comprehend.
----
2:172. O you who believe,
eat of the good things of that which We have faithfully provided you;
And give thanks to Allah, if it be Him you worship.
----
2:173. He has only made unlawful to you unslaughtered dead flesh, blood, the flesh of swine, or that hallowed when slaughtered to other than Allah.
So whoever is compelled by starvation, without liking to, or exceeding the least to survive, shall incur no sin thereby:
Truly Allah is all-forgiving, all-compassionate.
----
2:174. Verily those who conceal what Allah has previously sent down of the scripture, and eagerly fetch a miserable price thereby:
Those fill not their bellies but with hellfire,
and Allah shall not say a word to them on the Day of Resurrection or purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement.
----
2:175. It is they who have purchased pathetic misguidance with guidance and chastisement with forgiveness:
So how patient are they indeed with the hellfire!
----
2:176. That is because Allah has sent down the scripture with entire Truth;
And verily those who have divided into heretical schisms against each other over the scripture are lost in discord away.
