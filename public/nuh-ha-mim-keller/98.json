The very promise of Allah, utterly true;
And who is truer in word than Allah?

even the hole on the back of a date-stone.

4:125. And who is fairer of religion
than he who submits his whole being to Allah while excelling in good works, and follows the faith of Abraham, ever unswerving in devotion to the primal true faith?

4:127. And they ask you to make clear the rulings on women.
Say, 'Allah Himself shall clarify them to you, as shall that which is recited here to you in the Book, about hapless orphan women whom you do not give what has been bindingly prescribed them, but want to marry to obtain their wealth;
And what is recited to you about young children treated without rights or regard;
And that you are to champion justice for defenseless orphans:
And whatever good you do,
Verily has Allah ever known it full well?
