3:149. O you who believe, should you obey the unbelievers, they will thrust you back on your heels, so you renege from your faith completely ruined.
----
3:150. Rather Allah is your All-powerful Master, and He is the best of allies.
----
3:151. We shall cast whole dread into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they have ascribed partners to Allah
for which He has not sent down the slightest sovereign proof, and their refuge shall be the hellfire;
And how evil the biding-place of idolatrous wrongdoers!
----
3:152. Allah had truly kept you His promise, when you were making wide slaughter of them by His leave,
until, when you faltered and fell at odds over what you had been directly told to doâ€”.
And you disobeyed,
just after He had shown you what you had been so avidly desiring:
Some of you want this world, and some of you want the next.
Then He finally
turned you aside from routing them, to gravely try you;
And now He has truly pardoned you, and Allah is incomparable in favor to believers.
----
3:153. When you all made away in flight, not turning to heed anyone;
While the Messenger
was rallying you from your rear;
So Allah rewarded you with a swift-passing sorrow in the wake of the first sorrow, that you might not regret
what you could not do, or what befell you;
And Allah is well aware of all you do.
