----
4:80. Whoever obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah;
And whoever turns away,
We have not sent you as a keeper over them.
----
4:81. And they say, 'With all obedience!' But when they go forth from you, a cabal of them conspire in secret to do no way like what they say, while Allah writes all they devise;
So ignore them completely and trust wholly to Allah;
And Allah suffices to rely on.
----
4:82. Can they not have pondered the full import of the Quran?
Had it been from any but Allah Himself, they had found in it much discord.
----
4:83. And if any word reaches them of safety or fear, they uncritically spread rumor of it, while had they but referred it to the Messenger and men of true decision among them,
those of them who can draw the right conclusions about it would have certainly known how best to proceed with it:
If not for the bounty of Allah upon you and His mercy, you had followed the Devil, save pitiably few.
----
4:84. So fight on, even if alone, in the path of Allah:
You are not responsible for any but yourself;
And rouse true believers,
that haply Allah may balk the fury of those who disbelieve;
And Allah is more unsparing in fury, and of making a horrific example.
----
4:85. Whoever steps in to join men upon good shall be rewarded its full magnificent share;
While whoever steps in to join men upon evil shall bear its appalling deserts:
Verily Allah was ever an all-powerful watcher and guardian over the exact due sustenance and requital of every last thing.
----
4:86. And when you are given greetings of peace, return an even better, or the like of it;
Verily Allah was ever
over everything an infallible reckoner.
