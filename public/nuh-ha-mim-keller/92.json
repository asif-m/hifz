4:87. Allah, no god is there but He:
Verily He shall gather you all
to the Day of Resurrection, certain beyond doubt;
And who is truer of word than Allah?
----
4:88. So how can you be divided into two factions over the hypocrites, when Allah has turned them into unbelieving filth for what they have earned?
Do you mean to guide whom Allah has let stray?
And whoever Allah lets stray, you will never find for him a way.
----
4:89. They would just love for you to disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you would all be the same.
So take not from them any allies, until they emigrate in the way of Allah.
So if they turn away,
seize them and slay them wherever you find them, nor take from them any friend or helper;
----
4:90. Except those who reach the safekeeping of a people between you and whom is a solemn treaty;
Or come to you too oppressed of heart to either fight you, or fight their own people:
Had Allah willed,
He would have set them on you, and they attacked you;
So if they leave you be and fight you not and proffer you terms of peace,
Allah has made you no way against them.
----
4:91. And you shall find others who want to remain safe from you, and from their own unbelieving people;
Whenever they are returned to an open trial of their willingness to accept idolatry and fight for it, they are reduced therein to unbelieving vileness.
So if they do not let you be, and proffer you terms of peace, and stay their hands from fighting,
then seize them and slay them wherever you can catch them;
And against those We have given you sovereign clear authority.
