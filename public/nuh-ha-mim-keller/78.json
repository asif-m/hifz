4:7. Men shall have a share of what is left by parents and closest family,
and women shall have a share of what is left by maynes and closest family, of however little or much it may be:
a fixed due share.
----
4:8. And when the estate division is attended by your other non-inheriting relatives, and orphans and the impoverished,
provide for them out of what you have inherited, and speak kindly and graciously to them.
----
4:9. And let those in charge have fitting dread,
—who if they themselves were about to
die and leave behind young ones unable to fend for themselves, they would be apprehensive for them—
So let them fear Allah,
and say to orphans what is fitting and correct.
----
4:10. Verily those who wrongfully devour the wealth of hapless orphans but fill their bellies with fire,
and they shall roast in a horrific blaze.
----
4:11. Allah solemnly enjoins you regarding your offspring:
The male shall inherit the share of two females;
While if all are females, two or more, they inherit two-thirds of what the deceased leaves;
But if a female is the only child, she receives a half.
And his parents shall each receive a sixth of what he leaves, if he has any inheriting descendant;
Though if he has no inheriting descendant, and his two parents alone inherit from him, his mother receives a third;
While if he has full or half siblings, his mother receives a sixth;
—all shares of which are only taken after fulfilling any bequests made, or debts paid— Your inheriting ancestors or descendants:
None of you can know which of them are of greater benefit to you;
An absolute obligation fixed by Allah;
Verily Allah was ever all-knowing, all-wise.
