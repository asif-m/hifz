3:195. So forthwith their Lord well answered them:
"Verily I waste not the work of any worker of you,
man or woman:
You are of one another.
So all those who emigrated, and were expelled from their homes, and persecuted in My path, and who fought, and were slain,
I shall certainly absolve of their ill deeds, and enter them into lush-shaded groves of paradise beneath which rivers flow,
an unsurpassed reward from Allah Himself;
And with Allah
is the very perfection of reward?

3:198. But those who feared their Lord have luxuriant groves of paradise beneath which rivers flow, therein to abide, as but the first round of hospitality from Allah;
And that which is with Allah
is better for those devoted to Him in all works of good.

3:199. And verily of the people of the Book are those who truly believe in Allah and all that has been sent down to you, and sent down to them, humbled in awe to Allah;
They buy not a miserable price with the verses of Allah:
Those have their wage with their Lord Himself, and Allah is unerringly swift to reckon.
----
3:200. O you who believe: be undauntedly patient, outlast the foe, watch at the outposts, and fear Allah,
that haply you may succeed.
