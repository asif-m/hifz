4:141. Namely, the very hypocrites who are biding their time against you:
So if you win a victory from Allah,
they say, 'Were we not with you, to deserve the spoils?' And if unbelievers win the day in some paltry measure, they say to them, Did we not have the upper hand over you, yet hinder believers from harming you?' So Allah shall judge between you all on the Day of Resurrection;
And Allah shall never give unbelievers any way to vanquish true believers.
----
4:142. Verily hypocrites do their utmost to deceive Allah, while He is deceiving them.
And when they rise towards prayer, they do so laggardly, to be seen of men, and remember Allah but furtively little.
----
4:143. Wavering between faith and unfaith:
Belonging neither to these who believe, nor these who do not;
And whomever Allah makes to stray, you will never find him a way.
----
4:144. O you who believe,
take not unbelievers as protecting allies instead of believers:
Do you want to give Allah a clear sovereign proof against you?
----
4:145. Verily hypocrites
shall be in the very lowest depth of the hellfire;
And never shall you find them any who can help.
----
4:146. Save those who repent, and mend their ways,
and hold fast to Allah to protect them, and make their religion wholly sincere to Allah:
Those shall be with believers;
And Allah shall certainly give believers a mighty endless wage.
----
4:147. What should Allah accomplish by punishing you, if you show thanks and believe?
And verily was Allah ever supreme in thanks, all-knowing.
