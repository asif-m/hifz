2:135. And they say, 'Be followers of Judaism or Christians,
and you will be guided.?'
Say. Rather we are of the faith of Abraham, pure in his shunning idolatry for true religion, nor ever of those who ascribed partners to the Divine?
----
2:136. Say: 'We have believed in Allah
and what has been sent down to us and sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes, and what was vouchsafed unto Moses and Jesus, and vouchsafed to the prophets from their Lord, without differing between any of them;
While submitting ourselves to Him?
----
2:137. So if they believe in precisely what you have believed, they are indeed guided.
And if they turn away, they are but plunged in faction;
And Allah will certainly suffice you against them, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.
----
2:138. 'Allah has dyed our entire being with that one primal faith
as only Allah can dye it,
and is there any who dyes more beautifully than Allah?
While we worship none but Him?
----
2:139. Say, 'Do you dispute with us about Allah, when He is our Lord and your Lord, and our works are ours, and your works are yours;
While we are wholly sincere to Him?'
----
2:140. Or do you say that
Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes were followers of Judaism or Christians?
Say, Do you know better, or Allah?' And who is greater in wrongdoing than he who conceals a testimony entrusted to him by Allah?
And Allah is not the least heedless of all you do.
----
2:141. That indeed was a magnificent stock of people now come and gone:
None but they possess what they earned, and none but you possess what you have earned;
Nor ever shall you be asked about what they used to do.
