3:7. It is He who has sent you down the Book:
Some of its verses are unmistakably plain, which are the basis of the Book;
while others are subtle of understanding between nuances.
As for those in whose hearts is perverseness, they pursue only the subtle of it, seeking to sow doubts, and seeking to interpret it as they please, while no one knows its true interpretation but Allah and those firmly grounded in its knowledge:
They say, 'We believe in it,
each of these kinds of verses is from our Lord?
Yet none remember and heed but those of insight and mind.
----
3:8. 'Our Lord, turn not our hearts aside after having so completely guided us,
but bestow us from Your very presence a mighty mercy, Verily You alone are the Ever-bountiful Giver.
----
3:9. Our Lord, truly You shall amass mankind for an unspeakable day, no doubt is there in it;
Verily Allah fails not the tryst.'
