2:197. The time to enter pilgrimage is months well-known:
So whoever consecrates himself in them to perform the pilgrimage,
there is no inchastity, doing of wrong, or quarreling on the pilgrimage.
And whatever good you do, Allah knows it.
And take provision;
For verily the best provision is godfearingness.
And fear you Me,
O you of insight and mind.
----
2:198. No sin lies on you to strive by trade while on it for bounty from your Lord.
So when you pour forth from Arafat, make remembrance of Allah at the Sacred Landmark;
And make remembrance of Him befitting His supreme blessing of having guided you, while for the whole time before, you were of the woefully lost.
----
2:199. And of yet greater import, let you all pour forth from whence men have ever poured forth:
And ask Allah's forgiveness;
Verily Allah is all-forgiving, all-compassionate.
----
2:200. And when you have completed your sublime rites, make remembrance of Allah as you do the fame of your forebears, or remembrance far greater:
For of men is he who actually says:
O Lord, give to us in this world, while never in the next world shall he have any share of the good.
----
2:201. And of them is he who says:
Our Lord, give us in this world mighty good, and in the next world mighty good,
and protect us from the chastisement of the fire?'
----
2:202. Those, theirs is an incomparable share bestowed because of all they worked for;
And Allah is unerringly swift to reckon.
