2:177. Devotion to Allah in all works of good is not that you turn your faces to the east or west, but rather such devotion means he who believes in Allah and the Last Day, and the angels, and scripture, and prophets;
And who gives what he possesses though cherished to kinsmen, orphans, and the poverty-stricken, and to destitute wayfarers, and those who ask, and for bondsmen to purchase their freedom;
And who keeps well the prayer, and gives the due alms;
And those who keep their solemn word when they give it;
And above all, those who stand immovably fast in want and affliction, and the thick of deadly battle:
Those are who have proved true in word and deed, and those are the godfearing.
----
2:178. O you who believe, prescribed for you is the option for the kinsmen of murder victims to take retaliation against the killers:
No more than the freeman for murdering the freeman, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.
So whoever slays and is forgiven
by his brother who deserves to take vengeance anything of what the latter deserves to take by instead paying an indemnity,
let it be exacted civilly, and delivered graciously:
That is a great lightening from your Lord and a mighty mercy;
And he who ever transgresses after that shall have a painful chastisement.
----
2:179. And you have in the law of retaliation an abundance of saving life, O you of insight and mind,
that haply you may be godfearing and refrain.
----
2:180. It has been prescribed for you when death comes to any of you
and you leave behind considerable wealth, to make bequest to your parents and closest family with kindness and equity: a binding obligation upon the godfearing.
----
2:181. And whoever alters a bequest after having heard it, the crime of it but falls on those who alter it:
Verily Allah is all-hearing, all-knowing.
