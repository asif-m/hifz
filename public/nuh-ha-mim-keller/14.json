2:89. And when a mighty Book came to them from Allah Himself,
confirming what they already possessed,
-while just before they had been praying to Allah for triumph over unbelievers through the coming prophet
So no sooner had there come to them what they knew full well, than they disbelieved in it!
So the curse of Allah be on unbelievers.
----
2:90. How evil a price indeed
is what they have paid to gratify their selfish souls:
Disbelief in what Allah has sent down, out of arrogant vile envy transgressing all bounds, simply because Allah is sending down of His bounteous favor upon whom He wills of His servants:
So they came back having incurred utter divine wrath, on top of the utter divine wrath already on them;
And unbelievers shall have a humiliating chastisement.
----
2:91. And when they are told,
'Believe in what Allah has sent down,'
they say, "We shall believe but in what was sent down to us,' while they disbelieve in anything beyond it,
when it is the Truth confirming what they already possess.
Say, 'Then why have you slain so many of the prophets of Allah time after time before, if believers are what you be?'
----
2:92. Verily Moses had come to you with wondrous clear proofs, yet astoundingly you took the calf, just after he had gone,
committing appalling idolatrous wrong.
----
2:93. And remember
when We took solemn covenant of you, and raised up over you the very Mount of Sinai:
"Take firmly what We have bestowed on you, and hearken.'
They said: 'We hear' and 'We disobey':
so their hearts became drunk full with adoration of the calf, for their unbelief.
Say, How evil a thing indeed
is that which this faith of yours commands you, if believers are what you be?
