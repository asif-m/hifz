2:249. And when Saul set out with his hosts, he said, 'Verily Allah shall try you with a river:
So whosoever drinks of it is not of me;
While whoever does not taste it is of me,
other than to take a single scoop of it with his hand?
But they all drank their fill of it, save very few of them.
And when they had crossed beyond it, he and the obedient few who believed with him, they said: 'We have no strength this day to face Goliath and his hosts.' But those who well judged
they were certain to meet Allah said, How many a small fighting force overthrew a great one by leave of Allah;
And Allah is with the steadfast.'
----
2:250. And when they drew up on the plain against Goliath and his hosts,
they said, Our Lord, pour down fortitude upon us, and make our feet firm,
and give us triumph over the people of unbelievers?
----
2:251. And they smashed and routed them by leave of Allah;
And David slew Goliath,
and Allah gave him kingship and wisdom, and taught him of everything He willed.
Did Allah not repel some people with others,
the earth had been laid waste;
But Allah is of limitless bounty to all peoples of the world.
----
2:252. Those are the verses of Allah which We recite to you with utter Truth;
And truly you are of
the prophetic messengers.
