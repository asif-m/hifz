2:246. Or can you have not regarded the very nobles of the children of Israel, just after Moses himselfâ€”
when they said to a prophet of theirs,
'Send us a king, and we shall
fight in the path of Allah.'
He said, 'Or would you haply not fight,
even were fighting bindingly prescribed upon you?'
They said, 'And why should we not fight in the path of Allah, when we have been expelled from our homes
and from amongst our own sons?'
So no sooner had fighting been prescribed them than they turned round, all but a few of them;
And Allah well knows wrongdoers.

2:247. And their prophet said to them,
'Verily Allah has sent to you Saul as king.'
They said, 'How should he ever be king over us,
when we have a better right to kingship than he, nor has he been given any great wealth?
He said: 'Verily Allah Himself has chosen him over you,
and made him mightier in knowledge and build, and Allah gives His sovereignty to whomever He wills;
And Allah is vast of bounty, all-knowing?
----
2:248. And their prophet said to them,
"Verily the sign he is to be king
is that the Ark of the Covenant shall come to you again, in which there is sublime peace from your Lord, and precious relics passed down
by the house of Moses and house of Aaron, borne by angels;
Truly in that is a mighty sign for you, if believers you be?
