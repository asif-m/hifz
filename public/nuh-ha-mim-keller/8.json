----
2:49. And remember when We full mightily delivered you from the men of Pharaoh,
inflicting endless dire chastisement on you, slaughtering your sons,
and sparing your women unto bondage;
And in that was a dreadful trial from your Lord.
----
2:50. And remember when We parted the sea with you, and speedily saved you,
and drowned the men of Pharaoh,
as you watched.
----
2:51. And when We agreed to meet Moses in forty nights;
Yet incredibly you took the calf just as soon as he had gone, committing utter idolatrous wrong.
----
2:52. Yet We pardoned you right after even that, that haply you might show thanks.
----
2:53. And remember when We gave Moses the Book and sole Criterion, that haply you might be guided.
----
2:54. And when Moses told his people:
'My people, you have gravely wronged yourselves by taking the calf, so turn in true repentance to your Flawless Originator, and let the innocent of you slay the guilty:
That is better for you with your Flawless Originator.' So the moment you began, He relented toward you:
Verily He is the Oft-forgiving, the All-compassionate.
----
2:55. And remember when you said,
'Moses, never will we wholly believe you, until we see Allah with our own eyes?
And the thunderblast seized you as you watched.
----
2:56. Yet We raised you again to life, after your very death,
that haply you might show thanks.
----
2:57. And We spread over you cool shade-giving cloud, and bestowed on you manna and quails:
'Eat of the good things We have ever provided you?
And they wronged Us not, but always only wronged themselves.
