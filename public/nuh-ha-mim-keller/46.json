2:270. Whatever you spend, or vow you make,
Allah knows it full well;
And wrongdoers
have none to help them.
----
2:271. If you give every sort of charity openly, how excellent it is;
And if you conceal it, and give it to the poor, it is even better for you, and He will absolve you something of your ill deeds;
And Allah is well aware of all you do.
----
2:272. You are not bound to see they are guided, but rather Allah guides whomever He wills.
And whatever good any of you spend is but for yourselves, expending not,
save earnestly seeking nothing but Allah Himself.
And whatever good you spend shall amply be repaid you, you never being wronged.
----
2:273. It is for the impoverished:
Those constrained in the path of Allah who are unable to travel the land for gain;
Whoever did not know better would think them free of need, because they are too self-respecting to ask;
You can only tell them by their true extremity written in their looks;
They do not beg men importunately.
And whatever good any of you spend
Allah knows it full well.
----
2:274. Those who expend their wealth by night and day, secretly and openly,
they shall have their wage with their Lord, and need never be feared for, nor shall they grieve.
