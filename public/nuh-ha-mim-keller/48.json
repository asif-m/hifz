2:282. O you who believe,
when you deal with each other on credit for any debt due at a designated term, write it down.
And let a scribe record it between you with complete impartiality;
And let no scribe refuse to write it thus, as Allah has taught him.
So let him write;
And let him who must repay dictate it, and let him fear Allah his Lord,
and not try to surreptitiously lessen a single bit from it.
So if he who must repay is a fool with his money, or too mentally or physically infirm, or unable himself to properly speak to dictate, then let his guardian dictate with complete fairness.
And have it witnessed by two qualified witnesses from men of your own faith;
And if not two men, then a man and two women,
all of whom are those acceptable to you of qualified witnesses, so that if either of the two women err, the other may remind her.
And let no witnesses refuse when summoned.
And grow not tired of writing it down, be it meager or much, unto its due term:
All that is more equitable in the sight of Allah, more reliable to attest to,
and likelier to keep you from doubts.
But not however if it is present trade that you are conducting between yourselves, so there is no objection for you not to write.
And have witnesses present when you make business agreements with one another.
And let no scribe or witness be harmed:
If you do, it is villainy in you;
And fear Allah,
and Allah is teaching you,
and Allah knows well every single thing.
