4:92. It is not even remotely for any believer to slay another believer, save by mistake;
And whoever kills a believer by mistake must set free a believing bondsman, and an indemnity be submitted to the slain's kin,
unless they forgo it out of charity.
So if the slain was of an unbelieving people at war with you, but himself a believer,
then a believing bondsman must be freed, while if he was of a people between you and whom is a treaty, then an indemnity must be submitted to his kin,
and a believing slave freed,
while whoever finds no means to free one must fast two consecutive months:
All of which is so Allah
may grant whole forgiveness;
And Allah was ever all-knowing, all-wise.
----
4:93. And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his requital shall be the glowering hell abyss, therein to abide,
and Allah be wroth with him, and curse him,
and ready for him an immeasurable chastisement.

4:94. O you who believe,
when you travel to do battle in the path of Allah, always find out the truth first,
and say not to him who salutes you with greetings of peace:
"You are not a believer,
seeking the passing advantages of this paltry world: for with Allah are spoils aplenty.
You were no different from them, not long ago,
and Allah showed you supreme favor for a single word of faith:
So always find out the truth first;
Verily has Allah ever been well aware of all you do.
